## Thankyou for visiting my page 

This 2D Drawing Robot is based on arduino gantry system which drawys on paper if we input g-code which is created from image
by external software like inkscape.

It has
X - Axis 
Y - Axis 
z - Axis (For writing pen/marker suspension)

## Gripper for the drawing marker
 the Gripper is still yet in design process 
I am doing heavy research on it to make compitable with this robot speed.

## Aim of the Project

- To reach the drawing speed of 1m/s

- To make drawing even on un parallel surface (non-Planar) surface

- Future versoin of the is going to combine with AI and draw your object or face if that is shown to camera

- High for value-cost ratio

## The Frimware is open source and i have attached with this folder.

Thankyou guys
